                        We all intend to plan ahead, but too often let the
                        day-to-day minutia get in the way of making a calendar
                        for the year. Sure, you can’t know every detail to
                        anticipate. Heck, you can’t know half the priorities
                        that will pop up in any particular month. But you can
                        plan for big picture seasonality, busy-times, and
                        events.
